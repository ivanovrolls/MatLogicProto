# MatsLogic - What is it?

MatsLogic is a web-based application designed for Brazilian Jiujitsu (BJJ) practioners to map out graphs of their gameplans. These graphs will be represented using edges and nodes, where each node will represent individual moves, and edges will represent relationships between moves. AI will be used to recommend new nodes, and help practitioners flesh out their gameplan. Clicking on nodes will prompt users to add images and video links. Users will also be asked to visualise the technique, and write a step by step process to execute it to help them internalise it.
